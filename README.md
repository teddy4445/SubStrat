# SubStrat Architecture
## What the use case SubStrat solve:
    
    Reduce the time of AutoML computation time while retaining the output model performance.
    The strategy of SubStrat is reducing the size of the dataset for faster AutoML computation time.

## Requierments:
1. model accuracy needs to be similar to regular runs of AutoML for the same Dataset.
   * Less than 5% decrease in accuracy.
   * The user should be able to change the accuracy for faster results. 
2. By default implement the reduction size of the database using the algorithm shown in the article.
    * The user should be able to change the implementation of the reduction size of the data.
3. Support of multi AutoML platforms.
   * Easy interfaces for adding new platforms.
   * At the first one platform each time, maybe later multi platform at any time.
4. Easy to use
    * the flow is:
      * data reuction size(substrat by default)
      * Fit
      * Fine-tune
   * It should be easy for the user to run all the 3 steps, mainly because the user probably has lots of steps for his workflow, and adding another step should be easy.
5. Support any size of data, even data that canâ€™t be loaded for the RAM at once.
    * At start SubStrat will only support only that can be loaded in on time to the RAM, 
    * In the future we will support bigger databases.

6. enable to compare?

```python

class BasicSummaryAlgorithm(object):

        def _evaluation_function(self, data: pd.DataFrame,  subset_data:pd.DataFrame) -> float:
            # We already have some implemented function the the user can use.
            raise NotImplemented
        
        def run(self) -> pd.DataFrame:
